It looks like there are two issues:  

1. **Subscription ID Issue**: The Azure CLI is reporting that the provided subscription ID does not exist in the Azure cloud environment.  
2. **Terraform Configuration Issue**: Terraform requires the `subscription_id` in the provider block to authenticate properly.  

---

## **Step 1: Verify Subscription in Azure**  
Run the following command to list all available subscriptions:  

```sh
az account list --output table
```

This will display all subscriptions associated with your account. Make sure that `ce7fad2a-6e41-49b9-a22e-d69ad1670beb` is listed.  

- If the subscription exists but is **not active**, switch to it using:  
  ```sh
  az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"
  ```
- If the subscription **does not exist**, check your Azure portal and ensure you have access to the correct subscription.

---

## **Step 2: Update Terraform Provider Configuration**  
Modify your `main.tf` file to include the correct `subscription_id`:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}

  subscription_id = "your-correct-subscription-id"
}
```

Replace `"your-correct-subscription-id"` with the actual subscription ID obtained from `az account list`.

Save the file and re-run:

```sh
terraform init
terraform plan
```

---

## **Step 3: Retry Terraform Plan**  
If the issue persists, authenticate explicitly in Terraform using Azure CLI:

```sh
az login
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="your-correct-subscription-id"
export ARM_CLIENT_ID=""
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=""
export ARM_TENANT_ID=""
```

Then, run:

```sh
terraform plan
```
